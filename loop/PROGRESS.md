# Progress Log (lab notebook)

> Append-only during the loop. This file is the loop's cross-iteration memory: the next
> fresh-context iteration learns dead ends, pinned decisions, and known limitations ONLY from here
> and from git history. Thin entries starve later iterations — write decision-record grade notes.

## Entry anatomy (follow this shape)

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — {{phase/task id and title}} (DONE | BLOCKED)

- Tests first: {{suite/file, N new cases}}; watched them fail RED ({{the actual failure message}})
  before implementing.
- {{What was built or changed — one or two factual sentences.}}
- DECISION — {{the decision, pinned}}: {{rationale in one or two sentences; what was rejected and
  why}}. (add "flagged for human review" when non-obvious)
- KNOWN LIMITATION (recorded): {{honest deferral or edge left open, and why it is acceptable now}}.
- Gate: typecheck OK, lint clean, {{N}} tests pass (was {{M}}; +{{K}}) at {{coverage}}, build OK.
- Next: {{the single next task, per the plan}}.
```

Rules (from the reference build's real notebook):

- Record decisions WITH their reasoning. A bare "chose X" cannot stop a later fresh-context
  iteration from re-litigating X; the rationale can.
- Record failures and dead ends explicitly — preventing re-attempts is this file's whole purpose.
- Record known limitations at the moment you accept them, not when they bite.
- Tag anything a human should re-check with "flagged for human review".
- Include the gate numbers (test count delta, coverage) so progress is measurable, not narrated.
- Docs-only or verification-only iterations still get an entry (state what was verified and that
  nothing testable changed).

## Log

### 2026-07-10 — Spec locked, scaffold created (human session) (DONE)
- Brainstorm completed interactively; decisions ratified into MANIFESTO.md and docs/DESIGN.md
  (full type safety; immutable op-list core; Bun toolchain; refusals list closed).
- Template scaffold applied; gate.sh wired to `bun run typecheck/lint/test/build` (fails until
  loop Phase 0 creates package.json — correct backpressure).
- No source code exists. Next: planning mode generates IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for M1.
